## What If You Forget Your Jenkins Password?

Let’s talk about a situation we don’t usually think about…  
What if you forget your **Jenkins password**? Or worse — what if **the Jenkins admin** forgets theirs?

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1747972387841/d6f304b2-8fc9-40a6-b78e-07d48767d397.jpeg align="center")

## Real-Time Setup & Daily Workflow

1. **Default Admin**
    
    * When you first install Jenkins, it creates a built-in `admin` user.
        
    * You set an initial password at first launch (from the autogenerated secret).
        
2. **Create Your Own Admin Account**
    
    * Immediately create a new user (e.g. `beth_admin`) with full admin permissions.
        
    * Log out of the default `admin` and only use `beth_admin` (or another named account) going forward.
        
3. **Spin Up Project Users**
    
    * For each team/environment—`dev`, `test`, `prod`—create dedicated Jenkins accounts.
        
    * Grant roles/permissions scoped to those folders, jobs, or pipelines.
        
4. **Ongoing Maintenance**
    
    * If the testing team forgets their `test_user` password:
        
        1. Log in as `beth_admin`
            
        2. Go to **Manage Jenkins → Manage Users**
            
        3. Select `test_user` → **Configure** → **Reset Password**
            
    * Share the new password securely.
        

## Scenario 1: A Regular User Forgets Their Password

When any non-admin user loses access:

1. User reaches out to the Jenkins **admin**.
    
2. Admin resets the password via **Manage Jenkins → Manage Users**.
    
3. Admin communicates the new credentials securely.
    
4. User logs back in and can continue work instantly.
    

## Scenario 2: The **admin** forgets the password

You might think: *Who resets the admin’s password then?*  
In **99.99%** of real-time production environments, this isn’t a problem. Why?

### ✅ Real-World Strategy

* We **don’t rely** on just one admin account.
    
* We assign **admin rights** to more than one user.
    
* We **don’t use the default admin account** once Jenkins is set up.
    
* Admin credentials are often stored in secure tools like **AWS Secrets Manager**, **Vault**, **1Password**, etc.
    

But what if everything fails?

### 💥 Worst Case: All Admin Credentials Lost!

Let’s take an analogy:

> You lock yourself out of your car with the keys inside.  
> What do you do? You might break the window to get in.  
> Similarly, in Jenkins, you can break in — but safely.

### Here’s how 👇

### Jenkins Emergency Access – Resetting Admin Password

1. SSH into your Jenkins server (e.g., EC2 instance).
    
2. Navigate to the Jenkins home directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd /var/lib/jenkins/
    ```
    
3. Open the `config.xml` file:
    
    ```bash
    sudo vim config.xml
    ```
    
4. Find and change:
    
    ```bash
    <useSecurity>true</useSecurity>
    ```
    
    to
    
    ```bash
    <useSecurity>false</useSecurity>
    ```
    
5. Restart Jenkins:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart jenkins
    ```

    * Now, when you access Jenkins in the browser, it will **skip the login** and take you directly to the dashboard.

        </iframe>
        
    
6. Go to:
    
    * **Manage Jenkins → Configure Global Security**
        
    * Turn **security back on**: set `useSecurity` to `true`
        
    * Choose **Jenkins’ own user database**
        
    * Save settings
        
7. Go to **Manage Jenkins → Users**
    
    * Find your admin user ID
        
    * Click on it → Change password
        
8. Finally, go to:
    
    * **Manage Jenkins → Configure Global Security**
        
    * Set **authorization** to: "Logged-in users can do anything"
        
    * Save
        

🔁 You’ll now be redirected to the login screen.  
Use your new credentials to log in.

## Forgot Your **Username** Too?

No problem—list the users directory:

```bash
cd /var/lib/jenkins/users/
ls
```

Each folder name corresponds to a Jenkins user ID. Spot your username in the list, then use it to log in or reset its password.

## Key Takeaways

* **Always** retire or rename the default `admin` user after initial setup.
    
* **Maintain** at least two active admin accounts to avoid single points of failure.
    
* **Use** a dedicated secrets management solution for storing and rotating credentials.
    
* **Schedule** regular, automated backups of your `$JENKINS_HOME` (including `config.xml`).
    
* **Document** these recovery steps in your team’s runbook and **practice** them in a staging environment.
    

> **Pro Tip:** Running a quarterly “lost password” drill on a test Jenkins instance will ensure your team stays sharp—no surprises under pressure!
